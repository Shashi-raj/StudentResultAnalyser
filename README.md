A student result analyzer is a tool or system designed to evaluate and interpret the academic performance of students based on their results in tests, exams, assignments, or other forms of assessment. This system helps educators, administrators, and sometimes students themselves to gain insights into academic trends, identify areas of improvement, and make data-driven decisions for educational development.
